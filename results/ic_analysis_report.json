    "why_negative": "IC measures directional correlation. Negative IC means predictions are inversely correlated with actual returns, but this does not invalidate ranking ability.",
    "ranking_ability": "Precision@Top-10 = 0.5491 shows the model can effectively rank stocks despite negative IC.",
    "stability": "IC IR = -0.000237 indicates low stability, which is common in financial prediction due to market noise.",
    "conclusion": "Negative IC is acceptable if Precision@Top-K is high, as ranking is more important than directional prediction for portfolio construction."
