# requirements.txt - Project Dependencies

# Phase 1: Data Collection
pandas
numpy
yfinance
requests
pathlib

# Phase 1: Feature Engineering
# Note: TA-Lib requires system library first:
#   macOS: brew install ta-lib && pip install TA-Lib
#   Linux: sudo apt-get install ta-lib && pip install TA-Lib
#   If installation fails, code will use pure Python fallback implementations
TA-Lib                 # For technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.) - Optional, has fallback
seaborn
stable_baselines3
scikit-learn           # For StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler
scipy                  # For cosine similarity calculation (if needed)

# Phase 2 onwards (Anticipated)
torch                  # PyTorch base
torch-geometric        # PyG for Graph Neural Networks
torch-sparse           # Sparse tensor operations for neighbor sampling
pyg-lib                # PyG extensions for faster sampling operations
networkx               # For basic graph analysis/manipulation
stable-baselines3      # For Reinforcement Learning Agent (if using common RL libraries)

# Additional dependencies for mini-batch training
tqdm                   # Progress bars for training loops

# Phase 3: Visualization and Metrics
matplotlib            # Plotting library for confusion matrix and training curves
seaborn               # Statistical visualization (heatmaps, confusion matrix)
tensorboard           # TensorBoard logging for training monitoring
