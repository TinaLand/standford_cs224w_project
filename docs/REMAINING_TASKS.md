## ⚠️ Remaining Optional Tasks

### 1. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)

**Task**: Phase 4 Hyperparameter Sweep
- **File**: `scripts/phase4_hyperparameter_sweep.py` (already exists)
- **Purpose**: Find optimal hyperparameter configuration
- **Time**: 2-4 hours (requires multiple training runs)
- **Priority**: Low (current performance is already good)

**Command**:
```bash
python scripts/phase4_hyperparameter_sweep.py
```

### 2. Complete Ablation Experiments (Optional)

**Task**: Complete ablation experiments (requires retraining)
- **Status**: Framework implemented, but needs to retrain model for each configuration
- **Time**: Very time-consuming (each configuration needs to train GNN + RL)
- **Priority**: Low (framework exists, results already generated)

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Ablation framework implemented
- ✅ Already run (using existing model evaluation)
- ⚠️ Complete version requires retraining (high time cost)

### 3. Phase 7 Extensions (Optional)

**Task**: Advanced extension features
- **Dynamic Graph Updates**: Implement efficient dynamic graph update mechanism
- **Multi-Agent RL**: Design multi-agent architecture
- **Priority**: Very Low (beyond proposal scope)

### 4. Documentation Completion (Recommended)

**Task**: Final report writing
- **Status**: All data ready
- **Needs**: 
  - Organize all results
  - Write final report
  - Prepare presentation materials
- **Priority**: High (needed for project completion)

**Available Data**:
- ✅ All performance metrics
- ✅ All comparison results
- ✅ All visualization charts
- ✅ Improvement analysis documentation

### 5. Infrastructure Improvements (Optional)

**Task**: Code quality and engineering
- **Unit Tests**: Add test cases
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
- **Priority**: Very Low (research project, not production code)
