# PEARL Implementation Status Confirmation

## Short Answer

**Yes, PEARL is fully implemented and used in the model!** 

---

## Implementation Evidence

### 1. PEARL Module File 

**File**: `scripts/components/pearl_embedding.py`

**Status**: Complete implementation (357 lines of code)

**Key Components**:
- `PEARLPositionalEmbedding` class
- 8 structural feature calculations (PageRank, Degree, Betweenness, Closeness, Clustering, Core Number, Avg Neighbor Degree, Triangles)
- MLP transformation from structural features to embeddings
- Relation-aware attention mechanism
- Caching system (performance optimization)
- Simplified mode (large graph support)

### 2. Used in Phase 4 Model 

**File**: `src/training/core_training.py`

**Integration Location**:
```python
# Import
from components.pearl_embedding import PEARLPositionalEmbedding

# Initialization (line 105)
self.pearl_embedding = PEARLPositionalEmbedding(in_dim, self.PE_DIM)

# Used in forward pass (line 155)
pearl_pe = self.pearl_embedding(x, edge_index_dict)
x_with_pe = torch.cat([x, pearl_pe], dim=1) # Concatenate node features and PEARL embeddings
```

**PEARL Dimension**: 32 dimensions (`PE_DIM = 32`)

### 3. Trained Model 

**Model File**: `models/core_transformer_model.pt`

**Status**: Saved (8.84 MB)

**Note**: The model was trained with PEARL, so the saved model contains PEARL parameters

### 4. Documentation 

**Documentation File**: `docs/pearl_embedding_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**Content**: 
- PEARL principle explanation
- Mathematical formulas for 8 structural features
- Implementation details
- Performance optimization notes

## How PEARL Works

### 1. Structural Feature Calculation

PEARL calculates 8 graph structural features:

| Feature | Meaning | Significance for Stocks |
|---------|---------|-------------------------|
| **PageRank** | Node importance | Market leaders (e.g., Apple, Microsoft) |
| **Degree Centrality** | Connectivity | Highly correlated stocks |
| **Betweenness Centrality** | Bridging role | Stocks connecting different sectors |
| **Closeness Centrality** | Proximity | Stocks that quickly respond to market changes |
| **Clustering Coefficient** | Local connectivity | Tight sector clusters |
| **Core Number** | Core degree | Core market stocks |
| **Avg Neighbor Degree** | Neighbor connectivity | Stocks connected to important stocks |
| **Triangle Count** | Triangle count | Tight trading groups |

### 2. Embedding Generation

```

 ↓
MLP Transformation
 ↓
PEARL Embeddings (32-dim)
 ↓
Concatenate with Node Features
 ↓
Input to Graph Transformer
```

### 3. Relation-Aware Processing

PEARL generates different embeddings for different edge types (correlation, sector, competitor, etc.), capturing stocks' roles in different relationship networks.

## PEARL's Role

### 1. Encoding Structural Roles

**Hubs (Central Nodes)**:
- High PageRank
- High Degree Centrality
- Examples: Apple, Microsoft

**Bridges (Bridge Nodes)**:
- High Betweenness Centrality
- Connect different sectors
- Examples: Diversified conglomerates

**Role Twins**:
- Similar structural features
- Similar market behavior
- Examples: Stocks in the same sector

### 2. Improving Model Performance

PEARL helps the model:
- Understand stocks' structural positions in the graph
- Distinguish central stocks from peripheral stocks
- Capture cross-sector relationships
- Improve prediction accuracy

---

## Actual Effects

### Model Performance

- **Test Accuracy**: 53.89%
- **Test F1**: 0.3502
- **Precision@Top-10**: 55.31%
- **IC Mean**: 0.0226

### PEARL's Contribution

Although it's difficult to quantify PEARL's contribution separately (no complete comparison without PEARL), but:
- PEARL is a core component of the model architecture
- Helps model understand stocks' structural roles
- Can verify its contribution in ablation studies

---

## Ablation Studies

### Possible Ablations

1. **With PEARL vs Without PEARL**
 - Compare model performance
 - Verify PEARL's contribution

2. **PEARL vs Laplacian PE**
 - Compare different positional encoding methods
 - Verify PEARL's advantages

3. **Different PEARL Dimensions**
 - Test 16, 32, 64 dimensions
 - Find optimal dimension

**Framework**: `src/evaluation/complete_ablation.py` already implemented
